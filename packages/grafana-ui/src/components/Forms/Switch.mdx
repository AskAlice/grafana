# Switch

### When to use

A switch is a representation of an on-off state – like a light switch. So you can use a switch to toggle binary states.

Switches trigger changes immediately. If your component should trigger a change only after sending a form, it's better to use a checkbox instead. Furthermore, switches cannot be grouped – each switch triggers an independent state. If you want multiple mutually exclusive choices, radio buttons are the better option. To offer multiple choices within the same group or context which are not mutually exclusive, use checkboxes instead.


### Usage

```jsx
import { Forms } from '@grafana/ui';

<Forms.Switch disabled={...} checked={...} onChange={...} />
```

### Props
<Props of={Switch} />
